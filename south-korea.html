        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <article>
          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>An independent kingdom for much of its long history, Korea was occupied by Japan beginning in <time datetime="1905">1905</time> following the Russo-Japanese War. In <time datetime="1910">1910</time>, Tokyo formally annexed the entire Peninsula. Korea regained its independence following Japan's surrender to the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> in <time datetime="1945">1945</time>.</p>

          <p>After World War <data value="2">II</data>, a democratic government (Republic of Korea, <abbr title="Republic of Korea">ROK</abbr>) was set up in the southern half of the Korean Peninsula while a communist-style government was installed in the north (Democratic People's Republic of Korea, <abbr title="Democratic People's Republic of Korea">DPRK</abbr>).</p>

          <p>During the Korean War (<time datetime="1950">1950</time>-<time datetime="1953">1953</time>), US troops and <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> forces fought alongside ROK soldiers to defend South Korea from a DPRK invasion supported by communist China and the Soviet Union. A <time datetime="1953">1953</time> armistice split the Peninsula along a demilitarized zone at about the 38<sup>th</sup> parallel.</p>

          <p>PARK Chung-hee took over leadership of the country in a <time datetime="1961">1961</time> coup. During his regime, from <time datetime="1961">1961</time> to <time datetime="1979">1979</time>, South Korea achieved rapid economic growth, with per capita income rising to roughly 17 times the level of North Korea in <time datetime="1979">1979</time>.</p>

          <p>South Korea held its first free presidential election under a revised democratic constitution in <time datetime="1987">1987</time>, with former ROK Army general ROH Tae-woo winning a close race. In <time datetime="1993">1993</time>, KIM Young-sam (<time datetime="1993">1993</time>-<time datetime="1998">1998</time>) became the first civilian president of South Korea's new democratic era.</p>

          <p>President KIM Dae-jung (<time datetime="1998">1998</time>-<time datetime="2003">2003</time>) won the Nobel Peace Prize in <time datetime="2000">2000</time> for his contributions to South Korean democracy and his "Sunshine" policy of engagement with North Korea. President PARK Geun-hye, daughter of former ROK President PARK Chung-hee, took office in <time datetime="2013-02">February 2013</time> as South Korea's first female leader.</p>

          <p>In <time datetime="2016-12">December 2016</time>, the National Assembly passed an impeachment motion against President PARK over her alleged involvement in a corruption and influence-peddling scandal, immediately suspending her presidential authorities. The impeachment was upheld in <time datetime="2017-03">March 2017</time>, triggering an early presidential election in <time datetime="2017-05">May 2017</time> won by MOON Jae-in.</p>

          <p>South Korea hosted the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in <time datetime="2018-02">February 2018</time>, in which North Korea also participated. Discord with North Korea has permeated inter-Korean relations for much of the past decade, highlighted by the North's attacks on a South Korean ship and island in <time datetime="2010">2010</time>, the exchange of artillery fire across the <abbr title="demilitarized zone">DMZ</abbr> in <time datetime="2015">2015</time>, and multiple nuclear and missile tests in <time datetime="2016">2016</time> and <time datetime="2017">2017</time>.</p>

          <p>North Korea’s participation in the Winter Olympics, dispatch of a senior delegation to Seoul, and three inter-Korean summits in <time datetime="2018">2018</time> appear to have ushered in a temporary period of respite, buoyed by the historic US-DPRK summits in <time datetime="2018">2018</time> and <time datetime="2019">2019</time>.</p>
