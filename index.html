    <h2>French Specialties</h2>
      <p>As someone that was born and raised in France, I can testify that the passion French people have for their cuisine is not a myth. They take pride in their cooking traditions and practices. Starting in the Middle Ages, French cuisine evolved over centuries, shaped by the neighboring countries of Belgium, Germany, Spain, Italy, and their habits.</p>

    <h2>Regional Dishes</h2>
      <p>Demarcated by thirteen regions and over a hundred departments, the regional cuisine in France is vast and exceptionally diverse. Respectively, regions have their own authentic cuisine, built on different heritage and culinary arts. At present, I will introduce several dishes made in these regions while listing the ingredients used in each recipe.</p>

    <h2>Haute Cuisine</h2>
    <p>Grande Cuisine is performed by distinguished establishments or gastronomic restaurants. Chefs employ conscientious and fastidious methods to prepare and present the food to customers at a premium price. In the 19th century, at the origin of haute cuisine was Georges Auguste Escoffier, who played a key role in the modernisation of the culinary arts. It is progressively labeled as cuisine classique. A century later, the term nouvelle cuisine emerges in response to Escoffier's dogma. The movement puts an emphasis on conceptualism and minimalism. Chefs such as Paul Bocuse, Alain Chapel and Michel Guérard apply these modern principles to their cooking.
